# 1. Easy Labs

These topics are foundational and relatively straightforward. Practice them **2–3 times** to ensure you’re comfortable with the concepts and configurations.

- **Configure and verify IPv4 addressing and subnetting**  
  Frequency: 2–3 times (critical for the exam).
- **Configure and verify IPv6 addressing and prefix**  
  Frequency: 2–3 times (IPv6 is increasingly important).
- **Configure and verify device access control using local passwords**  
  Frequency: 2 times (simple but essential).
- **Configure and verify NTP operating in a client and server mode**  
  Frequency: 2 times (straightforward but often overlooked).

# 2. Medium Labs

These topics are moderately challenging and require a deeper understanding. Practice them **3–4 times** to build confidence.

- **Configure and verify VLANs (normal range) spanning multiple switches**  
  Frequency: 3–4 times (VLANs are a core topic).
- **Configure and verify interswitch connectivity**  
  Frequency: 3–4 times (trunking and 802.1Q are key).
- **Configure and verify Layer 2 discovery protocols (Cisco Discovery Protocol and LLDP)**  
  Frequency: 3 times (important for troubleshooting).
- **Configure and verify IPv4 and IPv6 static routing**  
  Frequency: 3–4 times (static routing is fundamental but not overly complex).
- **Configure and verify access control lists**  
  Frequency: 3–4 times (ACLs are critical for security).
- **Configure and verify WLAN within the GUI using WPA2 PSK**  
  Frequency: 3 times (GUI-based, but wireless is important).

# 3. Hard Labs

These topics are more complex and require hands-on practice to master. Practice them **4–5 times** or more until you’re fully confident.

- **Configure and verify (Layer 2/Layer 3) EtherChannel (LACP)**  
  Frequency: 4–5 times (EtherChannel can be tricky).
- **Configure and verify DHCP client and relay**  
  Frequency: 4–5 times (DHCP relay can be challenging).
- **Configure and verify single area OSPFv2**  
  Frequency: 4–5 times (OSPF is a major topic).
- **Configure and verify inside source NAT using static and pools**  
  Frequency: 4–5 times (NAT is challenging but essential).
